Simple login page with test file to ensure that only appropriate characters may be used for username and password.

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) and [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) must be installed before running.

## Usage

#### Cloning & Setup

**Note:** You may need to remove or rename the .babelrc file in the main directory in order for this to work.
